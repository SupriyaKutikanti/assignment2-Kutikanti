## The countries i like to visit
I suggest this four countires thoses are India France Canada Japan beacuse India has over 300,000 mosques and over 2 million Hindu temples, France is one of the oldest nations on Earth and the most ethnically diverse country in Europe, Canada is a country filled with famous landmarks, historical wonders, delicious food, incredible culture, and all the outdoor exploration you could want. Japan is known for everything from onsen hot springs and kabuki baths.
